# About
* What is this repo?
> This is a slightly modified fork which includes some extra features & memes added to my liking.
* How's this different from the main repo?
> * This repo comes with my RSS feed parser module **rss-chan** integrated. You'll never be late to your mirroring schedules now. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/hyPnOtICDo0g/rss-chan).

>  * Added support to the `/mirror` command to automatically detect an URL when replied to a certain message. This should work for any URL (Magnet, Torrent, Mega & Direct links) you throw at it since it uses regex.

> * I've made some improvements to the search module, such as:  
>   * Search filter to display (only) folders/files. Folders have been set as the default filter. Files can be searched by appending `-f` to a search query.
>   * Time taken + Number of results found are displayed.
